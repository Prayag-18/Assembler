# Assembler

    An assembler is a software tool or program that translates assembly 
    language code into machine code, which can be directly executed by 
    a computer's processor. It plays a vital role in the development of
    low-level software and system programming, as it bridges the gap 
    between human-readable assembly instructions and the binary
     representations understood by the hardware.

    Assembly language is a low-level programming language that closely 
    corresponds to the machine language instructions of a specific 
    computer architecture. It uses mnemonic codes to represent individual 
    instructions, memory addresses, and data operands. Assembly language 
    provides a more human-readable and manageable alternative to working 
    directly with binary machine code.

    The assembler reads the assembly code, processes each instruction, 
    and generates the corresponding machine code.
